### Known Issues & Limitations

| Issue | Impact | Status | Workaround |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| Limited to Euro currency | Predictions only in € | Known limitation | Use exchange rate converter for other currencies |
| Dataset from 2017-2018 | Prices may not reflect current market | Acknowledged | Consider 10-15% inflation adjustment for 2024-2025 |
| No dedicated GPU specification | Gaming laptop predictions less precise | Planned for v2.0 | Model infers GPU from "Gaming" type and price range |
| Weight input as text field | Potential for invalid entries | Minor UX issue | Client-side validation restricts to 0.69-4.7 range |
| Single-model comparison | No "compare laptops" feature | Enhancement planned | Run predictions separately and compare manually |

**Upcoming fixes:**
- Add GPU specification input field (v2.0 - Q2 2024)
- Implement multi-currency support (v2.1)
- Create comparison mode for multiple laptops (v2.2)
- Update dataset with 2024 laptop prices (v2.3)
